    <string name="how_to_inst1">The main button on top of the screen is the global orientation for all the apps. This is just a shortcut to
        the setting\'s option to change global orientation.
    </string>
    <string name="how_to_inst2">Then you can select from the list for every app your desired orientation. Your selection will override the
        default global orientation.
    </string>
    <string name="how_to_inst3">If you want only two apps to rotate and all the others to stay at their default, just disable global
        orientation and then select both Portrait and Landscape for the specific app in the list.
    </string>
    <string name="how_to_inst4">After you have selected your desired apps, just click on play and your settings will be in effect.</string>
    <string name="how_to_inst5">Also, there is an option in the settings tab where you can set the app to start on boot. If you select it,
        then every time your phone boots it will remember your configurations and the app will run automatically.

        is forced to portrait or landscape view. See instructions for more information.\n\nIt is an open source project created by SpyDiKo team, aiming to keep things simple and functional.\nContact
